name: Ultimate S.K.A.T.E. Training

use a queue or a list or something and load the tricks into that, then remove them once the trick has been done success-
fully

have a Land class or something that contains Land and Fail - Land and Fail each get a percent chance for the computer's
turn

either make it simulate an actual game of skate (tricks get harder as it goes on) or just randomly choose any trick ava-
ilable (different game modes?)

maybe have a berrics rules and an anything goes (no-complies, etc.)

possibly have a list of round 1 tricks and their percentages, round 2, and etc.

"suggest tricks" feature - send me trick suggestions

provide an "about" or "info" section with each trick listed for every difficulty level and such

search suggestions for trick names on the user's turn

have a choice for selecting multiple terrains (flatground & rail, quarterpipe & ledge & manual pad, etc.

have a "bank" terrain

save letters and wins and other stats to a text file - one for the details of each match, one for general statistics like
total letters and total wins and losses and such

for player's turn where they enter a trick: create a dictionary where the trick is the index - {int num, str trick} ->
then use the num you retrieved as the index for the trick LIST to determine what the trick is

maybe use a dictionary or something for the tricks and landing probability values for different turns? i dunno
